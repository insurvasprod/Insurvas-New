-- LA-2.13 criterion 5, second pass · retrieve, then rank
--
-- After the contact-rate counters the number moved from 812.7ms to 89.5ms per serve at 200 queued
-- leads. Better by an order of magnitude, and still not under fifty.
--
-- What remains is not a slow query, it is a linear one: about 0.45ms per candidate, times however
-- many candidates the queue happens to hold. Tuning that constant buys a bigger queue before the
-- criterion breaks again; it does not stop it breaking. LA-1.10 and backlog #177 already set the
-- target at a hundred thousand leads, and nothing that scores every one of them will hold.
--
-- So the queue retrieves a bounded candidate set and ranks only that. Cost becomes constant in the
-- depth of the queue, which is the property the criterion actually needs.
--
-- THE PRE-FILTER IS RECENCY, AND THAT CHOICE IS LOAD-BEARING. The obvious pre-filter — take the
-- first fifty in the naive order — would have been exactly wrong. The naive order is oldest-first,
-- and `recency` carries the largest default weight of any signal and favours the newest. Pre-
-- filtering by the naive order would hand the scorer the fifty leads most likely to score worst,
-- and the feature would have measured as worse than no feature at all while appearing to work.
--
-- The cost is recall: a lead outside the fifty most recent cannot win, however well it would have
-- scored on its other six signals. That is a real limitation and it is the reason the number is
-- fifty rather than five — wide enough that the other signals decide the order within it, narrow
-- enough that the work is bounded.
--
-- The off path is now literally the LA-2.8 query, unreached when scoring is disabled, rather than
-- the scored query with its terms evaluating to null. Criterion 4 asks that scoring can be turned
-- off entirely without breaking the queue, and the strongest form of that is the old code still
-- being the code that runs.
